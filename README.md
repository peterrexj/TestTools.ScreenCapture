# TestTools.ScreenCapture

This is a very simple tool to capture screenshots and consolidate into a word or pdf document. Can be used for many purposes from manual testing artefacts collection or use of capturing screenshots and consolidate requirement.

Uses Win Forms, C#, and .NET 6.0 (as our team was using Windows OS) to create a tool with the following features:
•	Turning on the tool
•	Selecting the monitor to capture screenshots
•	Choosing the folder to save the screenshots
That's it! Continue with testing, taking screenshots using the print screen function. Once the testing is complete, hit the "generate" button in the tool, which would compile the screenshots into a Word or PDF document, providing us with the desired artifacts, very simple!
