This tool provides a simple way to capture screenshots and consolidate them into a Word or PDF document. It can be used for various purposes, such as collecting artifacts during manual testing or capturing screenshots to document requirements. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing users to easily capture and organize screenshots for their specific needs.


This tool is built using Win Forms, C#, and .NET 6.0, primarily targeting Windows OS. It offers a range of features that streamline the screenshot capturing process. The tool allows users to:

* Enable the screenshot capture functionality
